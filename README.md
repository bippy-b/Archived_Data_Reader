# Archived Data Reader
When data was removed from our database servers the data was saved as an XML file.  Occasionally  we needed to dive back into those files to answer questions a client/sponsor had about data or the status of a shipment.  This is a program i wrote that could read the files and search very quickly to find the data and get an answer back to the client quickly.

This was one of the very first programs I wrote so be kind about the code. :)
